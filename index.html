        <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
        
        <p class="bio">Hi I'm Myra Rudy! (Pronouced /ˈmɪrə/ or meer-uh) I am a student in the <a href="https://www.yearup.org/" target="_blank">Year Up</a> program taking courses through Seattle Central College.</p>
        
        <p class="bio">I originally learned web development in middle school, but I haven't done much with it since high school. I'm currently re-learning and would love to have a fully developed site to display my work by the end of my program.</p>
        
        <p class="bio">The photos shown here are photos of my girlfriend, taken by me. We met on a game in virtual reality called VRChat. Eventually I would like to have a page with my favorite photos that I can use as a sort of photography portfolio.</p>
        
        <p class="bio">I was born in Utah where I lived until I was 8. My dad lost his life to leukemia in 2008, about a year before my mom finished college. My mom, my brother and I then moved to NYC as my mom obtained an internship there. We lived there for 11 years and I personally consider it the place I grew up in. While living there, my mom re-married and had two more sons, making me the eldest of 4. My step-dad obtained a job in Seattle early 2020 and was given resources to relocate which ended up taking 2 years because of COVID and the housing market. My oldest brother and I moved to Gig Harbor end of 2021 and lived with our grandparents until our parents were able to find a house.</p>
            
        <p class="bio">I have way too many hobbies, many of which are very expensive. Skip the following paragraphs if you don't want to read me go ultra nerd mode about my hobbies.</p>    
        
        <p class="bio">I've been rock climbing since I was 11, around 5 years of my experience have been 3 days a week. I used to dream about becoming a professional climber but never ended up committing enough time into it.</p>
                    
        <p class="bio">I also love photography. I have been interested in photography for as long as I can remember. I always wanted to own a high end camera but I never owned one until about a year ago. My grandpa gave me a very cheap point and shoot camera which I used for a little while, but by the time I was in high school, most phones were already better than it. I first remember taking photos of my friends & I skateboarding. I ended up not taking skateboarding as seriously and just took photos of scenery. Then after moving to WA, I became more interested in cars and started taking photos of cars. Now that I've started Year Up, I have less time to go to car events, but mainly take photos of people or just anything of interest.</p>

        <p class="bio">I also love basically anything related to physical hardwaare and physical computing. I remember messing around with my parents laptop when I was around 6 years old. Since then, I have always been involved with computers in one way or another. I built my first PC in high school and ended up buying and selling parts since. I consistenly change out my personal PC's parts so frequently that I don't think one part has stayed in it for more than a year.</p>

        <p class="bio">My newest hobby has been collecting high end audio listening equipment. Mainly headphones, but I have been trying out some IEMs (In Ear Monitors) as well. I typically use a pair called from Sennheiser called the HD800 or a pair from Focal called the Radiance. A goal I have is to own a pair of Utopias from Focal. I had the opportunity to try a pair in NYC last time I was there and it ruinied my sense of hearing in an amazing way. I can't describe the experience in any other way than saying that, after I left, my AirPods sounded like a $5 pair of wired earbuds that you doused in water.</p>
