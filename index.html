        <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>

        <p class="bio">Hi I'm Myra Rudy! (Pronouced /ˈmɪrə/ or meer-uh) I am a student in the <a href="https://www.yearup.org/" target="_blank">Year Up</a> program taking courses through Seattle Central College.</p>
        
        <p class="bio">I originally learned web development in middle school, but I haven't done much with it since high school. I'm currently re-learning and would love to have a fully developed site to display my work by the end of my program.</p>
        
        <p class="bio">The photos featured here are of my girlfriend, captured by me! She has been an amazing person since the day we met, and I feel very lucky to have her in my life. We met on a virtual reality platform called VRChat. I joined a random world, started talking to her and we ended up talking for about 6 hours straight. It turned out that she didn't live too far away, up in British Columbia. We first met in-person in Everett where I drove us all the way down to Portland for a concert, and then back to Vancouver the same day and night. If you click on the photo, it’ll take you to an album of some of my favorite shots I’ve taken. Photography has become a big passion of mine, and eventually, I want to create a dedicated page on my portal for it—keeping everything organized in one place.</p>
        
        <p class="bio">I was born in Utah and lived there until I was 8. In 2008, my dad passed away from leukemia, about a year before my mom graduated from college. Shortly after, my mom, brother, and I moved to NYC, where she landed an internship. We lived there for 11 years, and for me, it’s where I truly grew up. While in NYC, my mom remarried and had two more sons, making me the oldest of four. In early 2020, my stepdad got a job in Seattle, but it took two years (thanks to COVID and the housing market) for the whole family to relocate. My older brother and I moved to Gig Harbor in late 2021 to live with our grandparents until our parents found a home. I am forever grateful to my grandparents for being so supportive of everything I have been doing and for providing me with resources to get through the program.</p>
            
        <h2 style="margin-left: 0.7em;">Hobbies</h2>

        <p class="bio">I have way too many hobbies, it’s kind of a problem, and sadly most of them aren’t cheap. But if you’re curious, here’s me nerding out:</p>    
        
        <p class="bio">Rock climbing: I’ve been climbing since I was 11, with about five years of consistent practice throughout high school and a couple years after. At one point, I dreamed of going pro, but I never committed the time needed to make it happen and then ended up requiring lung surgery which made me lose a lot of strength and motivation. More recently, I've been trying to go when I have time even if it's only once a week. I'm hoping to get back into it as it is a great hobby and has always been more rewarding than a typical gym. </p>
        
        <p class="bio">Photography: I’ve always loved photography. My grandpa gave me a basic point-and-shoot camera when I was younger, but by high school, phones were already outperforming it. I started by taking photos of my friends skateboarding, then shifted to scenic shots, and now, after moving to Washington, I bought myself a Sony a6600 and started getting into car photography. Lately, I’ve been more focused on portraits and everyday moments since Year Up keeps me busy.</p>

        <p class="bio">Hardware tinkering: I’ve been fascinated with computers since I was 6, when I first started messing around with my parents’ laptop. I built my first PC in high school and eventually started buying and selling parts. These days, I swap out my personal PC’s parts so often that nothing stays in it for more than a year.</p>

        <p class="bio">High-end audio gear: My newest obsession is collecting high-end audio equipment. I mainly use headphones, like my Sennheiser HD800 or Focal Radiance, but I’ve been exploring IEMs (In-Ear Monitors) too. My dream is to own a pair of Focal Utopias. I tried them during my last trip to NYC, and they completely redefined how I hear sound. To put it simply, after experiencing the Utopias, my AirPods felt like $5 earbuds that had been dunked in water.</p>
