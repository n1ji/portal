        <p>Hi im Myra! (Pronouced /ˈmɪrə/ or meer-uh) I am a student in the <a href="https://www.yearup.org/" target="_blank">Year Up</a> program taking courses through Seattle Central College.</p>
        
        <p>I originally learned web development in middle school, but I haven't done much with it since high school. I'm currently re-learning and would love to have a fully developed site to display my work by the end of my program.</p>
        
        <p>The photos shown here are photos of my girlfriend, taken by me. We met on a game in virtual reality called VRChat. Eventually I would like to have a page with my favorite photos that I can use as a sort of photography portfolio.</p>
        
        <p>I was born in Utah where I lived until I was 8. My dad lost his life to leukemia in 2008, about a year before my mom finished college. My mom, my brother and I then moved to NYC as my mom obtained an internship there. We lived there for 11 years and I personally consider it the place I grew up in. While living there, my mom re-married and had two more sons, making me the eldest of 4.</p>
            
        <p>I have way too many hobbies, many of which are very expensive. Skip the following paragraph if you don't want to read me go ultra nerd mode about my hobbies.</p>
            
        <p>I've been rock climbing since I was 11, around 5 years of my experience have been 3 days a week. I used to dream about becoming a professional climber but never ended up committing enough time into it.</p>
